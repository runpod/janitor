# Disposable GPU Janitor Runner

## User Story

As a Janitor maintainer, I want to trigger a reproducible AWS GPU instance that runs Janitor against
a repository list and then shuts itself down, so that I can validate & auto-fix Docker repositories
without using my laptop and without incurring idle cloud cost.

## Description

Extend the existing Janitor system to support cloud-based execution:

1. Enable the Janitor to run on disposable AWS GPU instances for large-scale repository maintenance
2. Provide a one-liner command interface for triggering cloud-based Janitor runs
3. Implement automatic instance provisioning, execution, and cleanup to minimize costs
4. Support persistent Docker layer caching across runs to improve performance
5. Generate and store comprehensive reports from cloud executions
6. Ensure proper GPU access for Docker workloads that require GPU validation

The cloud runner should support:

-   Reading repository lists from committed YAML configuration files
-   Sequential execution against multiple repositories with proper resource management
-   Automatic instance shutdown after completion to prevent idle costs
-   Comprehensive logging and monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
-   Secure, least-privilege IAM configuration for cloud resources

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Users can trigger a cloud Janitor run with a single
    `make run-janitor ENV=dev REPOS_FILE=repos.yaml` command
-   The system provisions or starts an EC2 g5.xlarge instance automatically from a launch template
-   Janitor reads repositories from `infra/repos.yaml` (path configurable via `REPOS_FILE` environment
    variable)
-   Docker build layers persist across runs via a dedicated 50 GiB gp3 EBS volume for performance
    optimization
-   The workflow executes Janitor sequentially against the repository list without parallelization
-   JSON reports are automatically uploaded to the `janitor-reports` S3 prefix after completion
-   Instances automatically stop or terminate within 5 minutes of Janitor finishing execution
-   Users can retrieve reports locally using `make fetch-report ENV=dev` command
-   GPU verification confirms at least one NVIDIA GPU is available inside containers via `nvidia-smi`
-   CloudWatch logging captures all stdout/stderr from the Janitor container in `/janitor-runner` log
    group
-   The system detects and reports failures if unexpected ERROR lines appear in logs
-   Daily AWS costs remain ≤ $2/day when the system is idle
-   CI pipeline validates all infrastructure code with `make ci` (lint + terraform validate + packer
    validate)
-   The local command exits with status 0 upon successful completion

## Technical Notes

-   **Infrastructure Components**:
    -   Use Terraform for provisioning launch templates, security groups, IAM roles, S3 buckets, and
        EBS cache volume
    -   Use Packer to build GPU AMI with Docker and NVIDIA container toolkit pre-installed
    -   Implement bootstrap script for user-data that pulls Janitor image, runs job, uploads report,
        and self-terminates
-   **Monorepo Structure**:

    ```
    .
    ├── Makefile                     # Developer UX wrapper
    ├── packages/janitor-agent/      # Existing Mastra-based agent
    └── infra/
        ├── terraform/              # AWS infrastructure
        ├── packer/                 # GPU AMI definition

        └── repos.yaml              # Repository list
    ```

-   **Security Configuration**:

    -   Instance IAM role with least-privilege permissions:
        -   ECR access: `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`, `ecr:BatchGetImage`, `ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer`
        -   S3 access: `s3:PutObject` to `janitor-reports/*` and `janitor-cache/*` prefixes only
        -   CloudWatch Logs: `logs:*` on its own log group
        -   Systems Manager: `ssm:*` for remote access and command execution

-   **Development Workflow**:

    -   All make targets execute tools inside Docker containers to keep host environment clean
    -   Support for multiple environments (dev/prod) via `.tfvars` files
    -   Automatic Docker image building and ECR pushing via `make image`
    -   Infrastructure validation and application via `make infra-plan` and `make infra-apply`

-   **CI/CD Integration**:

    -   GitHub Actions workflow for infrastructure validation on PRs
    -   Release workflow for building and pushing Janitor Docker images
    -   Optional nightly workflow for automated maintenance runs

-   **Cost Optimization**:
    -   Use spot instances where appropriate for cost savings
    -   Implement proper instance shutdown mechanisms to prevent idle costs
    -   EBS volume persistence for Docker layer caching to reduce build times
    -   CloudWatch cost monitoring and alerting

## Example Usage

```bash
# Prerequisites setup
cp .env.example .env  # Configure AWS_PROFILE, AWS_REGION, ACCOUNT_ID
direnv allow

# Build and deploy
make image           # Build Janitor image & push to ECR
make infra-apply ENV=dev

# Execute cloud run
make run-janitor ENV=dev REPOS_FILE=infra/repos.yaml

# Retrieve results
make fetch-report ENV=dev

# Cleanup
make destroy ENV=dev
```
