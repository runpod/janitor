# Worker Repository Build Validator

## User Story

As a repository maintainer, I want an agent-based workflow using Mastra.ai that can validate the build process of multiple worker repositories, so that I can quickly identify which repositories have Dockerfiles that can be successfully built.

## Epic

This user story is part of the "RunPod Worker Repository Auto Maintenance" epic, which aims to create automated tools for maintaining and validating RunPod worker repositories.

## Description

Create a Mastra.ai workflow that:

1. Uses existing MCP servers from mcp.so for Git and Docker operations
2. Reads a file containing a list of repository names (e.g., "runpod-workers/worker-stable_diffusion_v2")
3. Implements a workflow with separate steps:
   - **Step 1**: Repository Checkout - Uses the GitHub MCP server to check out or update repositories
   - **Step 2**: Dockerfile Validation - Locates Dockerfiles in the repositories
   - **Step 3**: Docker Build - Uses the Docker MCP server to build images targeting linux/amd64
   - **Step 4**: Container Testing - Starts the Docker containers to verify they run correctly
   - **Step 5**: Report Generation - Creates a final report with build and test results
4. Includes an agent interface for interacting with the workflow and responding to failures

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system uses Mastra.ai's workflow capabilities to orchestrate the build validation process
- An MCP configuration connects to the GitHub MCP server (https://mcp.so/server/github) for repository operations
- An MCP configuration connects to the Docker MCP server (https://mcp.so/server/labs-ai-tools-for-devs/docker) for build and container operations
- The workflow accepts a path to a text file containing repository names, one per line
- Each step in the workflow includes proper error handling and reporting
- The workflow produces a clear success/failure report for each repository, including:
  - Build status (success/failure)
  - Container start status (success/failure)
  - Error information for troubleshooting failures
- An agent interface allows users to:
  - Start the validation process
  - View detailed reports
  - Get recommendations on fixing failed builds
- Containers started for testing are properly cleaned up after validation

## Technical Notes

- Implement using Mastra.ai's workflow and agent systems in TypeScript
- Leverage existing MCP servers from mcp.so:
  - GitHub MCP server for repository cloning, checkout, and updates
  - Docker MCP server for building images and managing containers
- Configure the MCPConfiguration class to connect to these servers:
  ```typescript
  const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
    servers: {
      github: {
        // GitHub MCP server configuration
      },
      docker: {
        // Docker MCP server configuration
      },
    },
  });
  ```
- Use Mastra's memory features to store validation results between workflow runs
- Configure proper error handling and observability to track the workflow's progress
- Implement the agent interface using Mastra's agent capabilities with LLM assistance for analysis
- For GitHub operations, set up with a GitHub Personal Access Token
- For Docker operations, ensure proper configuration for linux/amd64 platform targeting
